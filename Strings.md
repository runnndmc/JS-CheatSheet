## string.replace() 

a **method** that returns a **new** string with some or all matched of a pattern replaced by a replacement.

ex: 
```
let str = 'hello there'

let newStr = str.replace('there', 'friend');
console.log(newStr) ==> 'hello friend'
```

if there are multiple values that are the same - 
ex. "hello there there" - it would only replace the first one and not the second

you could instead use .replaceAll()
