## What is JS?
A programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard as a way to add programs to web pages. It's a dynamic language that creates modern web applications where you can interact directly without doing a page reload for each action. JavaScript is prototype-based, multi-paradigm language that object oriented and functional programing styles

## Main Data Types in JS:
+ Numbers
+ Strings
+ Boolean 
+ Null 
+ Undefined
+ Symbol 
+ Object


## What are Special Numbers in JavaScript?
Special numbers are: Infinity, -Infinity, NaN (even though it is a value of the number type)


## How does a program keep an internal state?
JavaScript provides a binding or a variable 

```
let ten = 10
console.log(ten * ten)
==> 100
```

the keyword let indicates that this sentence is going to define a binding called ten. 
After the binfing has been definedm its name can be used as an expression. 
The value od such an expression is the value that the binding currenty holds. 

## What is a JavaScript Environment?
the collection of bindings and their values that exist at a given time. The set of bindings that are defined. 

## What is a function?
a piece of program wrapped in a value that can be applied in order to run the wrapped program. 
Special values that wrap a piece of a program. 

## What is a conditional execution?
Where the program takes the proper branch based on the situation at hand. - created with an if statement 

## How would you introduce disturbances in the control flow?
By introducing a conditional (if, else, switch) or with looping statements (while, do, for)

## What creates a function value? 
When you use the function keyword as an expression. 

## What happens when you use function as a statement?
It can be used to declare a binding and give it a function as its value. 

## What is scope?
Part of the program in which the binding is visible. The scope could either be local, global or lexical (nested).

## How are properties accessed in JS?
value.prop or value["prop"]

## What are methods?
functions that live inside properties and usually act on the value they are a property of. 

## What is an abstraction?
Abstractions hid the details and give us the ability to talk about problems at a higher or more abstract level. 

## What are higher order functions?
Functions that operate on other functions either by taking them as arguments or returning them. This allows us to abstract over actions and not just values. 

## What is the difference between forEach and .map? 
forEach loops through the elements in an array and does not return any values once it has been run while .map performs a function on each value of an array and returns a transformed array with new values performed by the function.

## what is a regular expression?
objects that represent patterns in strings. They use their own language to express these patterns.

## What string methods are used for regular expressions?
 match, replace, search
